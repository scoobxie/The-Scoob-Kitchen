## 🎀 Overview
This simulator is a key part of my **Indie Game Dev** portfolio. The project transforms traditional culinary tutorials into an interactive experience, utilizing a technical pipeline that combines original video content with rigorous programming logic.

> All video assets are produced and edited by me, sourced directly from my **Twitch** streams. This project demonstrates my ability to manage both **Content Production** and **Software Architecture** simultaneously.

## 🛠️ Technical Deep-Dive (C#)
The system is built on software engineering principles designed to ensure scalability and performance:

* **Finite State Machine (FSM):** Cooking logic is driven by a state machine that validates user progression. The system ensures the player cannot proceed until the backend confirms the correct action has been performed.
* **Event-Driven UI:** Utilized C# Signals to separate logic from the interface, allowing for seamless transitions between the *Kitchen* and *Wardrobe* scenes.
* **Multimedia Sync:** Developed a custom controller for `VideoStreamPlayer` that synchronizes the game state with specific timestamps within the video tutorials.
* **Resource Optimization:** Implemented a cyclic iteration algorithm for the character customization system to manage textures efficiently without memory overhead.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Interactive Cooking:** Step-by-step simulator with real-time validation.
* **Multimedia Integration:** Video tutorials natively integrated within the game engine loop.
* **Custom Character System:** Wardrobe module for personalized visual experiences.
* **Professional UI:** User interface created in Adobe Suite, optimized for UX and aesthetics.
